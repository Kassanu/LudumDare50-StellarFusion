# Gameplay
Keep fusion happening to keep the star shining. Shift the elements on the board to cause collisions and fuse elements together.

# Controls
Moue and keyboard required. No mobile/controller support.  
WASD/Arrow Keys -> Shift tiles towards that direction  

# About
Thought of a 2048/Threes kind of game but about solar fusion. I didn't want to make an exact clone of these and had an idea of a twist for have a center cell that blocks tiles. And also tiles can combine with multiple other tiles and combinations can make multiple results etc. I think this idea can be cleaned up and made into a really fun puzzle game.
  
I spent a good amount of time this weekend on Wikipedia learning about these different reactions that happen in stars. This game covers the Proton-proton chain and CNO cycle. I left a bit out as I wasn't sure how they could be incorporated into the game. Check out the help menu in game to see a list of all possible fusions!

Thank you for playing!
